For your assignments, copy and paste the YAML header from the class website (.rtf file) exactly at the top of your R Markdown document.

Remember to also include the setup chunk right below the YAML header, and load your libraries right after that.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder) #only for this example
```

We can write normal text here.

We can also make **bold** and *italic* script. 

```{r}
#I can also write text as comments within a code chunk.
#The shortcut is cmd+alt+i (or ctrl+alt+i in windows).
```

Here is how numbering works.

# Heading 
## Subheading
### Sub-subheading

\medspace

I can suppress default numbering, by adding "{-}"

## Suppressed numbering here. {-}

\newpage

We can execute code in a code chunk, like this:
```{r}
2+2
```

We can do the same thing using inline code: two plus two equals `r 2 + 2`. 

\medspace

Here is a code chunk, displaying a table and the code used to generate it.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  head(5)
```

\medspace

Here is another code chunk, displaying a plot and the code used to generate it.
```{r}
plot(gapminder$year, gapminder$gdpPercap)
```

\newpage

## Code chunk display options {-}

In the setup chunk we set the global knit options to display **both code and results**, and suppress warnings and messages in our pdf output.

Usually, you will **not** have to change these settings when answering assignment questions.

For example, suppose I want to display the structure of the gapminder dataset.

- Use **{r}** for the default options

```{r}
table(gapminder$continent)
#default display, inherited from the setup chunk.
#this is how to display answers for most assignment questions.
```

\medspace

In very rare cases, we *can* change the display options within the code chunk.
Suppose I only want to display results, and not code. 

- Use **"{r echo = FALSE}"** in the chunk header to do this.

```{r echo=FALSE}
table(gapminder$continent)
```

\medspace

I can also display code, without results.

- Use **"{r results = 'hide'}"** in the chunk header to do this.

```{r results='hide'}
table(gapminder$continent)
```

\newpage

## Additional tips {-}

Don't include "clunky" output that is not integral to answering the question.

As an example, consider the following question: *what is the mean GDP per capita of the gapminder dataset?*

The following is not a very good approach, since the output is clunky.
```{r}
summary(gapminder)
#by inspection, 7215.3
```

\medspace 

The following is neater, but also not very good, since it still displays unecessary information, and the answer is "hard coded" - i.e. numbers are typed in - this is bad practice.
```{r}
summary(gapminder$gdpPercap)
#by inspection, 7215.3
```

\medspace 

The best way is to use inline code, as per below:

**The mean GDP in the gapminder dataset is `r round(mean(gapminder$gdpPercap),1)`.** *(Note here that the number is generated using code, not typed out)*

\medspace 

## Some final remarks {-}

- Do not hard code (i.e. do not type numeric values directly), instead, use inline code for simple calculations and code chunks for more complicated operations

-  **Fill in code in your .R script first, and make sure everything works as intended. Only transfer your code to R Markdown when you are happy with your .R script.**
