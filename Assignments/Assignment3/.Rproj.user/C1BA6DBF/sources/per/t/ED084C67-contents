## POLICY QUESTION FOR THIS WEEK & NEXT:
## Police can stop and ticket or arrest people for subway fare evasion. 
## Is there racial bias in NYPD enforcement of subway fare evasion?

## Lecture3/A3 examined this question using variation among arrested individuals.

## Lecture4/A4 examines this question using variation between subway stations


## --------------------------------------
## 1. load libraries and check directory
## --------------------------------------

#install.packages("weights")
#install.packages("lmtest")
#install.packages("sandwich")
#install.packages("knitr")

library(tidyverse)
library(weights)
library(lmtest)
library(sandwich)
library(knitr)

getwd()


## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Aggregating to subway station-level arrest totals
##
##  a. load full set of cleaned arrest microdata (arrests.clean.rdata)
##
##  b. aggregate microdata to station-level observations w/the following info:
##      - st_id, loc2, arrests_all (=arrest count)
##      - store results as new data frame st_arrests
##      - inspect new data frame (but don't include inspection code in submission)
##
##  c. plot histogram of arrests and briefly describe distribution of arrests across stations
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2a.
  load("arrests.clean.RData")

#2b.
  st_arrests <- arrests.clean %>% 
   group_by(st_id, loc2) %>% 
    summarise(arrests_all = n() ) %>% 
    arrange(desc(arrests_all))

  #inspect - DO NOT INCLUDE IN RMD SUBMISSION
  str(st_arrests)  #why is this so long?
  str(st_arrests, give.attr = FALSE)
  #can also consider ungrouping the st_arrests dataframe 
  
#2c.
  ggplot(FILL IN CODE)
  
  #remember ggplot is in the tidyverse, so we can also start by passing the data into a pipe
    st_arrests %>% FILL IN CODE

    
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. joining ridership and neighborhood demographics to arrest data
##
##  a. read in other station-level csv files (w/strings as factors) and inspect
##      - don't include inspection code in your rmd submission
##  
##  b. join both data frames to st_arrests & inspect results (store new df as st_joined),
##      - inspect results of join and describe any issues
##      - drop unnecessary columns from the ridership data
##      - group st_joined by st_id and mta_name
##      - inspect but don't include inspection code in your rmd submission
##        - confirm you have 157 station-level observations
##
##  c. print top 10 stations by arrest counts
##      - only display st_id, mta_name, arrests_all, shareblack, povrt_all_2016
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  #background on poverty data (from 2016 American Community Survey): 
  #  Source: https://usa.ipums.org/usa/acs.shtml
  #  each observation represents a "subway station area", defined as follows:
  #   - all census tracts w/geometric center within .5km of a station (see map)
  #  st_id is the unique identifier for each subway station area
  #  povrt_all_2016: % of adults in subway station area living below federal poverty level
  #  shareblack: share of adults in subway station area who identify as Black
  #  nblack: dummy variable = 1 if shareblack >= 50%, 0 otherwise
  
  
  st_ridership <- read.csv("Subway Ridership by Station - BK.csv", 
                           stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
  #background on MTA ridership data:
  #  Source: http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_sub_annual.htm
  #  each observation is a subway station (area) w/a unique identifier (st_id)
  #  includes annual ridership (# of MetroCard 'swipes') at each station for 2011-16

  #make sure to inspect these new df's before we join them in 3b!
  

#3b.
  
  #a vector of columns we don't need to keep, will use in 3b
  drop_vars <- c("swipes2011", "swipes2012", "swipes2013", "swipes2014", "swipes2015")
  
  #example: join st_arrests to st_poverty
  st_joinedtemp <- inner_join(st_arrests, st_poverty, by = c("st_id" = "st_id")) 
    #uh-oh, doesn't work!
  
  #what's the problem? st_id is a factor in st_arrests but an integer in st_poverty!
    #need to join on columns of the same data type
  FILL IN CODE TO FIX BEFORE TRYING JOIN AGAIN
  
  st_joinedtemp <- inner_join(st_arrests, st_poverty, by = c("st_id" = "st_id"))
  
  rm(st_joinedtemp)
  
  #in-class exercise: join all 3 data frames (in a single pipe if you can):
    #3 data frames to join: st_poverty, st_ridership, st_arrests
  st_joined <- st_arrests %>% 
    FILL IN CODE
    
  
  #why use all_of()? 
  #https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62397267/why-should-i-use-all-of-to-select-columns

  #inspect - DO NOT INCLUDE IN RMD SUBMISSION
    #display structure of ungrouped data frame to avoid lengthy output listing every group
    st_joined %>% ungroup() %>% str(give.attr = FALSE)
    summary(st_joined)
      #Note: 157 obs in joined df w/no NAs (except some missing demographics) 
      #inner join worked as intended!
  
  #QUESTION: could we have used full_join or left_join here instead of inner_join?
    
    
  
#3c.
  st_joined %>% 
    arrange(desc(arrests_all)) %>% 
    select(st_id, mta_name, arrests_all, shareblack, povrt_all_2016) %>% 
    head(n = 10) 


## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Explore relationship between arrest intensity & poverty rates across stations
##
##  a. compute variables for arrest intensity and other explanatory variables
##     - exclude coney island station from the analysis sample
##     - create new variable measuring fare evasion arrest intensity:
##       - arrperswipe_2016 = arrests per 100,000 ridership (swipes)
##     - create new dummy variable indicating high poverty station area:
##       - highpov = 1 if pov rate is > median pov rate across stations
##     - create new dummy for majority Black station areas (shareblack > .5)
##     - coerce new dummies into factors w/category labels
##     - assign results to new df called stations
##     - validate results 
##     - display top 10 stations by arrest intensity using kable() in knitr package
##       - only show st_id, mta_name, arrests_all and new columns
##
##  b. investigate arrests intensity vs poverty rates 
##     - plot arrperswipe vs povrt_all_2016
##     - should we weight stations by annual ridership?
##     - investigate linear and quadratic model fit 
##     - interpret your preferred regression specification (carefully!)
##  
##  c. report diff in mean arrest intensity between high/low pov areas
##     - weight observations by ridership for difference in group means
##     - is this difference statistically significant?
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. How does neighborhood racial composition mediate the relationship between poverty and arrest intensity
##    - examine relationship between arrest intensity & poverty by Black vs non-Black station area (nblack)
##
##    a. difference in means table: arrests per ridership by highpov vs nblack
##        - weighted by station ridership
##        - could difference in arrest intensity be explained by differences in povrt?
##
##    b. show and interpret a scatterplot of arrest intensity vs. pov rates by nblack w/your preferred regression lines
##        - use separate aesthetics to plot Black and non-Black station areas
##        - your plot should include your preferred regression estimates: linear or quadratic (not both)
##        - carefully explain which regression specification you prefer and why (linear or quadratic)
##        - if applicable, cite statistical evidence to support your decision.
##        - Interpret your preferred regression specification (carefully)!
##    
##    c. Next let's let's think about how measurement error might impact results from 5b.
##       Do you think measurement error could bias your estimates of neighborhood racial gaps
##       in the effect of poverty on enforcement intensity from 5b? 
##       Explain, carefully. 
##       Do you have any creative ideas to address concerns about potential bias from measurement error?
##    
##       (This is tricky! You'll want to consult your Quant II notes )

                             list("High Poverty" = highpov, "Predominantly Black" = nblack), 
                             mean) )
  
  #weighted difference in mean arrests
  #formula for the weighted mean = Σxw / Σw
    t1_arrper_wtd <-
      tapply(stations$arrperswipe * stations$swipes2016,
             list(stations$highpov, stations$nblack),

# 5c.  

    
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. Similar to analysis above, examine relationship between arrest intensity & criminal complaints
##  
##  a. read in crime data (nypd_criminalcomplaints_2016.csv) and join to existing stations df
##      - nypd_criminalcomplaints_2016.csv: 
##        - shows # of criminal complaints for each subway station area
##        - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i
##      - join on st_id
##      - exclude the stations with the 4 highest counts of criminal complaints
##        - why? bc they are in very close proximity to Brooklyn transit policing HQ,
##          and to Brooklyn criminal courts, so they don't face comparable
##          neighborhood policing conditions
##
##
## 6b. Examine the overall relationship between arrest intensity and crime 
##     without taking neighborhood racial composition or poverty into account 
##     (comparable to Section 4b)
##
##
## 6c. Examine how neighborhood racial composition mediates the relationship 
##     between arrest intensity and crime (comparable to Section 5b)
##  
##
##  NOTE: for 6b and 6c, you don't need to follow *all* the same steps in questions 3-5.
##  - focus on showing your preferred plots to inform the relationship, along with
##    any additional data manipulation & evidence to support your decisions/interpretation/conclusions
##  - explore the data before arriving at your preferred plots, don't show us everything
##    you tried, just the analysis you settled on as most relevant to this question
##
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------




## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 7. interpret your findings with respect to subway fare evasion enforcement bias based on race
##    - any additional analysis you'd like to explore with the data at hand?
##    - are there any key limitations to the data/analysis affecting your
##       ability to assess enforcement bias based on race?
##    - any additional data you'd like to see that would strengthen your analysis/interpretation
##    - for this question, try to be specific and avoid vaguely worded concerns
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
