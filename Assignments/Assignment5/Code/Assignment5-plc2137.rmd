# "Cross-sectional" analysis

In this section we'll explore variation in shutoffs *across* Census tracts (one observation per Census tract, summing shutoffs over the whole time period).

## Visualize and interpret the relationship between share Black and shutoffs per capita across census tracts in Detroit.

MI_acs_tract_10_17 <- readRDS("Data/MI_acs_tract_10_17.rds")

## Visualize and interpret the relationship between median income and shutoffs per capita across census tracts in Detroit.


## Visualize and interpret how shutoffs per capita relate to both Black share and median income on the ***same*** plot. Does race or income appear to be more salient?

# Time-series analysis.

In this section, we'll explore variation *between* different groups of Census tracts and over time *within* groups (with groups defined based on tract-level income and racial composition).

## Plot and interpret the shutoffs per capita over time for tracts below/above citywide median housheold income (show two time series on a single plot).

## Plot and interpret the shutoffs per capita over time for tracts that are at least 75% Black and those that aren't (show two time series on a single plot).

# Conclusion

## Based on the "cross-sectional" and time series analysis conducted above, does race or income appear to be a more important factor for explaining what type of households are most affected by the public water shutoffs? Explain.
