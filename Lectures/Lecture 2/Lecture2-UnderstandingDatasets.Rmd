# Describing datasets


## How was the data produced? {.unnumbered}

Common types of observational data:

* **Survey data:** survey responses from a sample of individuals
* **Administrative data:** administrative records from a gov't agency or organization


## Cross-sectional vs panel data {.unnumbered}

A **cross-section** of data is just a set of observations for one period of time. For example, a set of evaluations from students for a particular course in a given semester. You can imagine a second cross-section of data: a second set of evaluations from a different group of students for the same course but in a different semester. 

Multiple cross-sections of data can be combined into a single dataset, but that is different from **panel data** (also called longitudinal data) where the *same individuals* or entities are observed in each period.


## Unit of observation and representative population {.unnumbered}

It might seem obvious if you're working with familiar data, but in many cases it may not be immediately obvious: what is the *unit of observation* in the dataset you're working with, and what population are observations drawn from? In other words, what information distinguishes one row from the next: does each row represent a unique person, household, province, country, etc.? Or maybe a household-month or state-year pair, as examples of the unit of observation for hypothetical panel datasets. 

Note that researchers may use the term *unit of analysis* when it comes to data that may have been restructured for analysis, instead of the unit of observation in the raw data, but the underlying concept is the same.

Many large government surveys are based on a sample drawn at random from some broader population (e.g. a sample of working adults). Survey data requires you to apply **sampling weights** in order to obtain a representative population. This is because the likelihood of a subject responding to a survey is not random, but in fact depends on other variables such as age, gender, education, etc. 

Sampling weights serve to re-weight the data so people who were more likely to respond count less (and people who were less likely to respond count more). For survey data, you typically must use weights or else the sample wonâ€™t be representative of the true population of interest in terms of age, race, gender, etc.

For administrative data, on the other hand, each observation typically represent 1 record (e.g. a single case or program participant) and the data typically includes the entire "population" of cases. Administrative data often wasn't produced with the intent of outside analysis, so the documentation may be quite limited. All the more important to conduct exploratory data analysis to make sense of the data and identify inconsistencies or other issues.


# Application: comparing two datasets on unpredictable scheduling

Unpredictable scheduling refers to the practice of employers assigning shifts to their workers with short notice and irregular hours. Many low-wage employers are effectively forced to be on call to pick up shifts when told on short notice, with an unpredictable stream of income to pay bills, and often left scrambling for child care.

***Discussion questions:***

* *Cross-sectional or panel data?*
* *Unit of observation?*
* *Is it a random sample? What population is represented by the sample?*
* *Why do you think low-income NYers are over-sampled?*
* *Why is it necessary to use sampling weights when analyzing the data?*
* *Any concerns about how the data was generated (sampling scheme)?*
